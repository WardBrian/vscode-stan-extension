## Credits

This is a fork of the original [stan-vscode by ivan-bocharov](https://github.com/ivan-bocharov/stan-vscode).

The grammar was originally converted from the [atom-language-stan](https://github.com/jrnold/atom-language-stan) Stan package. The grammar has since been updated to support Stan v2.35.
